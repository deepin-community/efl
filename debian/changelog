  * d/patches:
    + 05-fix-signedness-mismatch.diff: fix a conflicting sign in evas
      (Closes: #748026).
    + 55_evas-gl-generic-common-add-more-linking-for-gles-mod.patch: drop,

  * d/copyright: use https Format link
  * d/control:

    + Set Rules-Requires-Root to disable building as root
  * d/rules: remove use of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  nocheck isn't explicitly needed
    anyhow, since configure is used to disable tests.
  * Ship efl-wl artifacts that should've been added with wayland support
  * Provide eo debugging tools.  libeo_dbg is a special build of libeo
    that includes additional debugging functionality.  It is designed to
    be LD_PRELOADed ahead of libeo.  eo_debug is a helper script to do
    that.  libeo_dbg can have significant performance overhead, so should
    not be used by default.
  * Eliminate use of debian/tmp from d/install, d/examples files
  * d/efl-doc.examples: fix source dir for example installation

efl (1.20.5-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * New upstream version

  [ Ross Vandegrift ]
  * libefl-all-dev needs to depend on libelementary-dev, libelput-dev.
  * d/libelocation1.symbols: correct versions to reflect eo release.
  * d/control: remove uses of deprecated Priority: extra.
  * Merge libe*-dev into libefl-all-dev, add transitional packages.  With
    split -dev packages, adding dependencies to match pkg-config
    requirements results in circular dependencies.  Also, upstream does
    not support or test building against part of EFL.  Combining these
    into a single dev package avoids both problems. (Closes: #878584)
    Since libector-dev is one of the dropped packages this Closes: #877180.
  * d/p/95-parallel-previews.diff: defuzz.
  * Bump all eo symbol versions for 1.20.5 release

  [ Andreas Metzler ]
  * Fix dependency info for eolian symbols by using upstreamversion-0~eo
    instead of upstreamversion+eo+1. The latter was automatically replaced
    with upstreamversion-1 since it sorted as greater than the uploaded
    version. Also update lintian-overrides accordingly
    (symbols-file-contains-current-version-with-debian-revision ->
    symbols-file-contains-debian-revision).
  * Refer to libefl-all-dev in the symbol files' Build-Depends-Package field.
  * List new symbol in libedje1.symbols and libector1.symbols.
  * Drop Priority field in efl-doc binary backage stanza
    (binary-control-field-duplicates-source).
  * Point watchfile to https URL.
  * In debian/rules use DEB_*_MAINT_APPEND to modify (L|C)FLAGS.

  * Build with Wayland support

  * Build-depend on libibus-1.0-dev to fix ibus support
  * Setup writable $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$HOME for build
  * Build with fake_home.sh to setup writable $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$HOME
    Needed because edje_cc now fails if it can't mkdir .run in one of these
    locations.  See src/lib/efl/interfaces/efl_vpath_core.c.
  * debian/libecore-bin.install: distribute libproxy isolation binary.
    Ecore now isolates its libproxy usage in a separate process.  This
    helps avoid crashes in scenarios where libproxy fails to handle
    exceptions.  See commit bd2f189d for details.
    - As a result, libecore1 now depends on libecore-bin.
  * debian/libelementary1.install: update wildcards to catch any new modules
  * debian/libecore-x1.install: drop removed ecore_x_* helpers
  * d/copyright: eliminate removed files

  * Remove empty shlibs:Depends from packages that don't need it
  * Switch to debhelper 10

    packages. When they're not present the build system disables libeeze, so
    that package is now linux-any.
  * debian/copyright: fix missing licenses for some files (Closes: #736914)

efl (1.8.4-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * debian/control: use misc:Pre-Depends instead of hardcoded multiarch-support
  * debian/control: all libecore packages are now Multi-Arch: same
  * debian: add the libefreet-bin package, necessary for proper efreet operation
  * debian: update the efreet packaging to work with Multi-Arch
    libefreet1 and efreetd communicate via d-bus, and there is a circular
    dependency between libefreet1 and efreetd, which make things difficult
    with Multi-Arch (as the helper binary had to be in a separate package).
    To avoid that circular dependency issue, libefreet1 is now a
    transitional package to libefreet1a and libefreet-bin and the
    libefreet1a shlibs file forces a Depends: libefreet-bin. Thanks to
    Josselin Mouette for the suggestion!
  * debian: add packaging information for Eeze

efl (1.8.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/control: Build-Depend on libudev-dev only for Linux architectures
  * debian/control: libevas1 Depends: libevas-loaders to support more formats
  * debian/control: drop B-D on librsvg2-dev, svg is handled via evas-loaders
  * debian/control: use Architecture: linux-any instead of hardcoded list
  * debian/control: mark libeet1 and libevas1 packages as Multi-Arch: same
  * debian/control: bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5, no changes required
  * patches/03_ecore_evas_extn_abi: remove, applied upstream
  * patches/03_no_ecore_audio_test: disable the Ecore_Audio testsuite.
    We don't ship libecore-audio but the testsuite seems to have issues at
    least on s390x. Since the library has other problems that make
    debugging difficult, disable the tests until it gets fixed.
  * patches/04_eina_file_hash_fix: cherry-pick cad0db51 to fix FTBFS on Sparc
  * debian/rules: use a large testsuite timeout to fix issues on slow buildds
  * debian: merge all libe*-doc into a single efl-doc package.
    The initial upload erroenously copied the complete doc in all the -doc
    packages, reuslting in much bigger packages than expected. Now that all
    libs are in the same source package, keeping separate -doc binary
    packages does not make much sense, so merge them all.

efl (1.8.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First upload of the merged EFL tree (Closes: #729751)
  * debian: add control and packages information from previous EFL packages
  * debian: bring back and refresh applicable patches from previous EFL packages
  * debian: move to a single debug symbols package for EFL
  * debian: core evas engines now ship with libevas1, drop libevas-engines-core
  * debian: upstream no longer provides static libraries
  * debian: fix install path for ecore and edje utility libraries
  * debian: remove evas loaders install; they'll be split in a separate package
  * debian: update Build-Depends as per new EFL requirements
  * debian/rules: always run autoreconf during build to get a recent version
  * debian/rules: force build with dev profile
  * debian/rules: add support for parallel builds
  * debian: add packaging information for EO.
    Since this a base EFL that all other libs depend on, integrate it with
    the eina package
  * debian: add packaging information for Eldbus.
    To avoid a circular dependency between eldbus and ecore (ecore modules
    depend on eldbus, eldbus depends on ecore), put the eldbus library in
    the libecore package
  * debian: refactor packages dependencies to be easier to maintain.
    Upstream always generates the .pc files to have dependencies between
    libs with the upstream version (ie. for EFL 1.8.3 all .pc files refer to
    1.8.3), so there's no point in trying to be clever: just use the
    source:Upstream-Version. Also, include Efl_Config.h in eina and make
    sure all -dev packages depend on libeina-dev to get that config header
  * debian/libevas1.symbols: mark all evas_common symbols as optional.
    Even if the evas_common symbols are exported, they are internal to
    Evas: they are only part of the internal engine API, but the symbols
    have to be exported because Evas module use them and we need to be able
    to resolve references to those symbols
  * debian/libecore-evas1.symbols: drop windows-only symbol removed from EFL 1.8
  * add patches/03_ecore_evas_extn_abi: cherry-pick e1b1296 to fix ABI issue
  * debian: add new symbols from this version in the symbols files
  * debian: add a DEP5-compliant copyright file
